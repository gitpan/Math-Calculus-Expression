Math::Calculus::Expression version 0.1
======================================

This module can take an algebraic expression, parse it into a tree
structure, simplify the tree, substitute variables and named constants
for other variables or constants (which may be numeric), numerically
evaluate the tree and turn the tree back into an output of the same
form as the input.

It supports a wide range of expressions including the +, -, *, / and
^ (raise to power) operators, bracketed expressions to enable correct
precedence and the functions ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec, cot,
sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, cosech, coth, asin, acos, atan, asinh, acosh
and atanh.
